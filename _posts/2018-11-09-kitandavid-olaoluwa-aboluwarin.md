Hi there, this is the first entry for our techie story. I hope you enjoy it.

# Name

KitanDavid Olaoluwa Aboluwarin

# Technology Specialization

Business Development Manager, Innovation strategist

# How did your journey in tech start?

I attended computer classes during my summer coaching in my secondary school days and I had this love for computers, I have practically used all windows OS from MS-DOS till date. Then in 2008, I picked up a course in Web component development using Java technologies and also floated my first Start-Up.  
I had more affinity to solving everyday problems using technology that for technology itself, one of the reasons I built a technical team of co-founders and I focused on solving problems, strategy and monetization.

# Have you had had any challenges?

First I had a learning problem and I found it very messy, so I had to sit down with my computer take more courses, get closer to people who have walked the road and now everyone knows I’m a great learner.

I also had funding as a problem, but then I got to know that often times, more than the idea, the investor invests in you, like can this guy run with my money. So I built up my personal profile showing my commitment to my enterprise and I got some funding after a lot of tries.

# What has your story in tech been like?

Today I “co-run” Planet NEST (http://planetnest.org) a technology hub known famously for its DevCRIB (a one year training for coders and enthusiasts in the MEAN and LAMP stack). Our DevCRIB students get a 3 Million Naira scholarship to NEST for a year where training and accommodation is free after which they stand a chance of getting a high paying job in African Tech Industry.

At NEST, we roll out two enterprise products and one not-for-profit solution every season.

# Any changes you would have loved?

Hnmmmmm.  
That everything I know today, I knew then 3 years back and things I’ll know next 10 years, I knew them today.

I really have minimal power over that but I’ve come to discover that a man’s status first changes in his level of knowledge.

# Any advice?

Free advice

Seek learning with all you’ve got.

I watch videos every day on every area of company building and Tech disruption

# Other Comments

I’m KitanDavid, I believe Africa has a great potential but only few Africans are ready to harness it. Be part of the few.
