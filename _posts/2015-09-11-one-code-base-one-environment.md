At Microsoft BUILD 2015 Conference, Microsoft announced that with one code, you can deploy your apps to all devices on running Windows 10.

That includes the IoT Devices, Laptops, Tablets, Phones, Surface Hub and Hololens. Isn’t this exciting. And what you need to get started is available right away.

# To-Dos

- Upgrade your laptop to Windows 10 (or get a new one running Windows 10)
- Download Visual Studio 2015 Community Edition (available via [Dreamspark](http://dreamspark.com) if you are a student)

Read my post on [getting started with Azure for Students](http://geekwithlife.com/azure-for-students-ramp-up/) (the first 2 parts) to know how to get started with using DreamSpark and diving into the world of real student productivity.

- Install Visual Studio (very easy to follow steps)
- Open Visual Studio and sign in with your Microsoft Account. Why login to Visual Studio? You may want to ask… 
    - Logging in give you the ability to see real insights into your application
    - Your settings are synchronized across devices (for example since 2013, I haven’t had to reconfigure my Visual Studio customizations, once I sign in, all my previous settings are applied for me automatically)
    - Connectivity to your Azure account live. ([Learn More](http://geekwithlife.com/azure-for-students-ramp-up/) on how to get started with that
- Now you got your tools set and in place to develop cools apps.
- If you are a beginner you can head to [Microsoft Virtual Academy](http://mva.microsoft.com) to learn and get the skill you need under your belt.

Developing for Windows 10 is really very cool and productive. You write your code once and you have the ability to deploy to the Surface Hub, Hololens, PC, Tablet, Phablet, Phone, IoT devices. Cool right? One Code to Run the All.
