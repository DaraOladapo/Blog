Hello there, It’s me again. This is for Streamers!

Updating you about one of those things I’ve been up to lately. As you most likely know (or not), I stream frequently and in my setup kit (link [here](https://daraoladapo.com/smooth-dev-saturday-stream-kit/)), I have no Stream Deck listed, I use an app called Deckboard (the pro version on Android – link [here](https://deckboard.app/)) and using James Montemagno’s Stream Timer app for countdown and count up (link [here](https://mystreamtimer.com)), the setup process work fine for those with a Stream Deck, I don’t have one and I’m not ready to invest in one yet so I developed an extension for his app to launch from Deckboard with the needed arguments. Pretty simple to use. See the setup guide and more information [here](https://daraoladapo.github.io/stream-deckboard/).
