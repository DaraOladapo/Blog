Hello, my name is Saviour, a student of The Federal University of Technology, Akure.  
I got into the school as a normal student with the aim of passing my exams and getting good grades. I never bothered myself about the world of technology until one fateful day as I browsed videos on YouTube, I saw something called the Microsoft HoloLens. I was astonished by the swift advancement in technology. The fact that science fictions are becoming reality was so exciting. I knew it all starts with knowing how to communicate with the computer.  
So I decided to be part of this change in any small way. I made up my mind that I want to learn how to talk with computers. So I happened to get in touch with MSPs in my school and It was fun at first learning a programming language and understand Windows Phone development from resources I got from Microsoft Virtual Academy and Channel9, but it soon became challenging, frustrating, and intimidating, but I thought to myself, what isnâ€™t?  
So I journeyed in the world of developers. Thank God for Microsoft DreamSpark, making available for me the professional tools I need to go through all these learning.  
MSDN soon became my everyday stop because of the drive to know more and more. I can boldly say that Microsoft have always had student developers in mind and have supplied awesome resources to help us achieve our goals. Try Microsoft ðŸ˜ƒ
