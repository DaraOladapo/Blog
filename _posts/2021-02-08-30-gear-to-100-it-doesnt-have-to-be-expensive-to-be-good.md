excerpt: "In my previous post, I talked a bit about how I started podcasting on a $30 microphone. I felt I should go a bit into the details of that and share a few more nuggets.\nWith this microphone, I recorded over 15 episodes of my podcast to reach over 1k listens. Some of it were crappy audio compared to the audio I produce now but they were good - at least better than nothing. I know friends who make awesome podcasts with a $10 lavaliere microphone.\nThe key is to start whatever you want to do with the least budget tools you can afford. If you have the money, of course incest in high quality gear, but you do not have to break the bank.\nWhen I got my Samson G-Track Pro, I had less work to do editing audio, but of course that meant I could use that extra time gained to produce more content.\nWhen I look at the first set of screencasts that I made back in 2015, I chuckle because I can see how far I have come. I made good content on my budget then, I make them on my budget now.\n\_\nMy point - your tools do not have to be expensive to get you started creating something good."

In my previous [post](https://daraoladapo.com/grow-from-where-you-are/), I talked a bit about how I started podcasting on a $30 microphone. I felt I should go a bit into the details of that and share a few more nuggets.

With this microphone, I recorded over 15 episodes of my [podcast](http://anchor.fm/thisdevlife) to reach over 1k listens. Some of it were crappy audio compared to the audio I produce now but they were good – at least better than nothing. I know friends who make awesome podcasts with a $10 lavaliere microphone.

The key is to start whatever you want to do with the least budget tools you can afford. If you have the money, of course incest in high quality gear, but you do not have to break the bank.

When I got my Samson G-Track Pro, I had less work to do editing audio, but of course that meant I could use that extra time gained to produce more content.

When I look at the first set of screencasts that I made back in 2015, I chuckle because I can see how far I have come. I made good content on my budget then, I make them on my budget now.

My point – your tools do not have to be expensive to get you started creating something good.
