Microsoft Azure by definition is a cloud computing platform and infrastructure created by Microsoft for building, deploying and managing applications and services through a global network of Microsoft-managed and Microsoft partner hosted datacenters. (source: Wikipedia)

# What Exactly is CLOUD?

Cloud Computing also known as on-demand computing, is a kind of internet-based computing, where shared resources and information are provided to computers and other devices on-demand.

Now not to bug your head over so much techie terms.

See the CLOUD as word used to describe a very large resource pool of VERY-HIGHLY-SUPER COMPUTERS you access via the internet. Using the cloud has numerous benefits to you and I as Individuals. For example, online storage as I have used have helped me a lot in my academic life. That is like the most basic scenario of using Cloud technology.
