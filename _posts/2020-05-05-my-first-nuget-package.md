Hey friends, it’s been a while since you heard from me, right? Well, I’ve been up to a number of things.

😭- Well, last week my Stream PC crashed so I had to ship it off for fixing. I should hopefully have it back this week – with a backup PC so we don’t miss out on Learn Wednesday and Smooth Dev Saturday anymore.

😊- Let me bring you up to speed on one of them. As you know I’m a developer. “Copy and Paste” is one of those things we developers do a lot. I realized I have been doing some repetitive Copy and Paste of the same bundle of code over the last 2 years, so I decided to package that up and make it available primarily for myself and then to other developers.

I called it the HttpClientServiceHelper. Here is what it does – simplify and abstract the use of the HttpClient Service in .NET for HTTP Calls – the POST, PUT, GET, DELETE, PATCH.

You can find the NUGET package at this [link](https://www.nuget.org/packages/HttpClientServiceHelper/) and you can find the open source project on [GitHub](https://github.com/DaraOladapo/HttpClientServiceHelper).

Let me know if you liked using it and if there’s something you’ll like me to improve on by raising issues and of course, you can do a PR to the repo!
