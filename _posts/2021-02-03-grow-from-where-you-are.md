Some of my readers know the village I come from and some do not – one day I will share that story. But today, I want to encourage you to start doing the things you hope to do in bits and grow gradually.

One of the major factors I would say impacted my growth – apart from God being by my side – is that I was intentional about improving my situation. I grew up in Ibadan (close to [Efunsetan Aniwura](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efunsetan_Aniwura)‘s residence), attended a public school from secondary to university (most think I attended a private school because of my posh-ness), and did not have everything figured out.

I decided to grow, nonetheless. I was robbed of my first laptop in 2011 (read about the specs [here](https://daraoladapo.com/a-3-w-coders-journey/)), but still taught CSC101,102, 201, 202 to my peers and others from second semester of 100L till I graduated 4 years after.

I travelled the country for my university and made my clan proud (I am not trying to blow my trumpet) during those 5 years of university study. Most folks ask me why I do what I do, part of the answers is [here](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/student-developer-blog/tinkerer-techie-teacher-meet-dara-oladapo/ba-p/311435).

Today, I have an impressive workspace setup at home, but I did not start from there and it is not even close to my dream setup yet, but I started anyway. Internet was a big challenge for me, I grew anyway – slower than others yes, but I grew.

When I started my podcast in 2020, I started on a $30 microphone (it could be me who does not know how to set it right), today I record on my [Samson G-Track Pro](https://amzn.to/39z3a7z) and a pro-grade recording software. I did not about all these nice tools till I decided to learn more.

When I look at how my video production has improved in the last 365 days to 5 year cumulative, I give myself a pat on the back and then a nudge to never stop there.

There is a lot to be said, but my main point is – **grow**, step-by-step from where you are. It may not be fast, it may be extremely hard, but grow anyway. **You can**.
