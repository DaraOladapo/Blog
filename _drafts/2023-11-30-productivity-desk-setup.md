# Introduction

I have been working from home since around the time COVID started and I have been trying to make my desk setup as productive as possible. I have been able to achieve this by using a combination of hardware and software. I will be sharing my setup with you in this post.

One of the major things to note in my setup is that I have grown into it and I did not get all the devices I use in one day or one month. I have been able to get them over time and I am still looking to improve on it.

It has  4 programmable modes which helps me just get a desired height without much. I decided to get this desk to save my back as I work and also to be able to move around while working. I have been able to achieve this with this desk.

Underneath the desk,  I have a `Cable Management Tray` from a brand called `Starttech.com` which helps me keep my cables tucked and also helps me move the desk around without having to worry about the cables getting tangled. I also have a couple of velcro straps, cable clips, and cable ties to help me keep the cables in place. To pass long cables between sitting and standing modes - because I have my desktop PC on the ground, I have a `Cable Management Sleeve` which helps me pass the cables through and clean. I st
