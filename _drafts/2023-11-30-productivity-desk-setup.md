# Introduction

I have been working from home since around the time COVID started and I have been trying to make my desk setup as productive as possible. I have been able to achieve this by using a combination of hardware and software. I will be sharing my setup with you in this post.

One of the major things to note in my setup is that I have grown into it and I did not get all the devices I use in one day or one month. I have been able to get them over time and I am still looking to improve on it.

I have two desk setups which I use. My primary setup which I use for extensive work and enables me to be fit as I work - I'll get to it in a bit. And the secondary setup is for recording and sort of a backup station.

# Primary Setup
I have a primary setup which I use for my day to day work. This setup is what I use for my day to day work, video editing, and any work that needs the major computing power of the desktop PC i have there. 

## Desk
I have a sit-stand desk from a brand called `Flamaker` which I mostly use in standing mode. It is 160cm by 80cm wide and comes with castor wheels for ease of moving around if I so need it - which I do a lot because I move my setup around many times a year to just have a new feel of the room. It has  4 programmable modes which helps me just get a desired height without much. I decided to get this desk to save my back as I work and also to be able to move around while working. I have been able to achieve this with this desk.

Underneath the desk,  I have a `Cable Management Tray` from a brand called `Starttech.com` which helps me keep my cables tucked and also helps me move the desk around without having to worry about the cables getting tangled. I also have a couple of velcro straps, cable clips, and cable ties to help me keep the cables in place. To pass long cables between sitting and standing modes - because I have my desktop PC on the ground, I have a `Cable Management Sleeve` which helps me pass the cables through and clean. It's not the sweetest looking cable management, but it works for now.

## Monitors

For my display, I use a quad monitor setup that consists of:

![Philips 34 inch curved monitor](../_posts/blog-assets/2023/11/philips-34-inch-monitor.webp)

1 Philips 346B1C 34" Curved UltraWide Monitor: this is where I do most of work from coding to video editing, and any work that requires huge screen real estate. It supports HDMI, Display Port and USB-C display options. If you're using the USB-C option, you can extend your computer's IO with the additional 4 USB ports to the left side of the monitor. It also has a built-in KVM switch which allows you to connect two computers to the monitor and switch between them with the press of a button supporting Picture in Picture and Side-by-side modes for two connected computers. I use this monitor for my main work and it's great. I have it in the a little bit to the side of my desk for now It's a great monitor and I love it.

2 HP 24" FHD IPS Monitors: One in landscape mode for secondary or reference coding, viewing browser tabs, meetings, screen sharing (because you know, not everyone uses an ultra-wide) and links to the main work I am on. 
The other in a flipped portrait mode for reading and consuming mainly docs and references while working. Sometimes, i have my chat windows on there.

1 EVICIV 16" Portable Monitor: This also serves as my mobile monitor whenever i'm on away from the house and need a secondary display. It's light, it's great and gets the job done for me.
When I'm doing code, cloud or DevOps work, I use it to display my terminals and other tools I need to get the job done. And when I'm doing video editing, I use it to display my assets folders, scripts and tasks.

## Monitor Arms
3 of the monitors on my desk are mounted up on 2 monitor arms to provide versatility of movement of adaptation for my setup.


![Dell MSA 20 Monitor Arm](../_posts/blog-assets/2023/11/dell-msa20-monitor-arm.webp)

The first one is the Dell MSA20 which holds the 34" Philips monitor and can hold up to 38" monitors. It has a great range of motion, a counter-balance system for heavy monitors and can be adjusted to any position I want. It also has a cable management grove in-built that helps me keep the cables in place. It's a great monitor arm and I love it so far since getting it.
